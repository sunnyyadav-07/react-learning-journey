# 🚀 React Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal **React Learning Journey** repository — where I document everything I learn daily while mastering React.js.  
This repo includes **notes, code practice, examples, UI demos, concepts, mistakes, and improvements** — all recorded chapter-wise, day by day.

---

## 📚 Why This Repo Exists?

I created this project with two goals:

1️⃣ Strengthen my React & JavaScript fundamentals through consistent practice  
2️⃣ Build a public learning portfolio that I can showcase on **LinkedIn, Resume & GitHub**

---

## 🗂 Project Structure

Each folder represents **one day of learning** with:
- 📒 Concept Notes (`notes.md`)
- 💻 Practice Code 
- 🧠 Key Takeaways
